# How to add documentation

## Preview documentation

You can preview the documentation on localhost by running the following command :

```bash
mkdocs serve
```

Local server will be available at [Localhost](http://localhost:8000) and has hot reload.

## Build documentation

After modifying the documentation you need to rebuild it by running the following command :

```bash
mkdocs build
```

## Deploy documentation

Once the documentation is build you need to deploy it on github page to do so we run the following command :

```bash
mkdocs gh-deploy
```

Documentation will be updated on github page and can be accessed at [Link](https://avella2409.github.io/Global-Documentation/)
